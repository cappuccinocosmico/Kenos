# Kenos

Do you love si-fi, but are sick to death of this old scientificly inacurate movie called *Star Wars*, confining the entire si-fi genera to a simple space western. And even when they are good, they continuesuly ignore [Basic Science][]

Then you have come to the right place, **Kenos** is a scientificly acurate picture of interplanatary space exploration that is set in 2100, all of this could have come about easily if we had just changed some laws and funded the [Right Projects][]

This will be using the good game [Kerbal Space Program][], and the [Realism Overhaul][] set of mods, in addition to other mods.

So if you enjoy science, but have never seen it accurately depicted in a sci-fi show, This is definitely for you.

Premires, July 1st at the Cappuccino Cosmico Youtube Channel.
